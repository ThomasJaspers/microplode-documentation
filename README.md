## Purpose of this Project

First of all having fun :-). Then learning something about technologies and techniques used when implementing *Microservices*.
But not only the technologies are important, but also comparing the whole "development experience" with building applications
as a monolith. Finally hopefully in the end there will be a working game.

Beside this documention that should always reflect the latest state of the project there is a series of blog posts
that are linked in the following. Those are dealing with the technologies used and experiences made in more detail.

<a name="the-game"></a>
## The Game

The game idea is leant on a known game principle, namely [Hexplode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexplode).
To simplify things *MicroPlode* is played on a plain 10x10 board as also described in more detail later on.

Players are making moves in turns. On a player's turn that player can occupy an empty field and thus giving it a load of 1.
Or the player can add a load of 1 to a field already occupied by that player and thus increasing that field's load by 1.
If a field has a higher load than the number of surrounding fields that field "explodes" and gives a lot of 1 to each
of those surrounding fields. Each field getting a load this way is afterwards owned by the player causing the explosion.
Any load that field had previously is staying on that field. This way it is possible to create really nice change reactions.

A field in a corner is always having three neighbouring fields. A field at the border is having five and a field in the
midlle of the board is having 8 neighbouring fields.

<a name="the-board"></a>
## The Board

For the time being the board always consists of 10x10 fields. Each field is identified by a pair of numbers identifying first
the line and then the row of the filed. This is shown in the following:

<pre>
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  0/0  |  0/1  |  0/2  |  0/3  |  0/4  |  0/5  |  0/6  |  0/7  |  0/8  |  0/9  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  1/0  |  1/1  |  1/2  |  1/3  |  1/4  |  1/5  |  1/6  |  1/7  |  1/8  |  1/9  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  2/0  |  2/1  |  2/2  |  2/3  |  2/4  |  2/5  |  2/6  |  2/7  |  2/8  |  2/9  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
...
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  9/0  |  9/1  |  9/2  |  9/3  |  9/4  |  9/5  |  9/6  |  9/7  |  9/8  |  9/9  |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
</pre>

Whenever the board is referred to fields are identified by this pair of number as shown above.

<a name="howto"></a>
## HowTo

You should get a Terminal (with Tabs!) started and install a RabbitMQ-Server, e.g. via brew install rabbit

You can start the board, game and computerplayerservice via simple

<pre>
mvn clean package

java -jar target/microplode-XYZservice-0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
</pre>

If you want to know, whatÂ´s going on inside the Messaging-Infrastructure, you could simply use the [RabbitMQ-Management-Plugin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) (which should be pre-installed in your installation) - open your Browser and type
<pre>
http://localhost:15672/
</pre>
with user and pw "guest".

To start the presentation service, refer to [its README](https://github.com/ThomasJaspers/microplode-presentationservice/blob/master/README.md). TL;DR: `git clone git@github.com:ThomasJaspers/microplode-presentationservice.git`, `npm install`, `npm start`.
